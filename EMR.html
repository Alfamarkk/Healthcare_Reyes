					<h2>Electronic Medication Reconciliation (eMR)</h2>
						<p>
							Electronic Medication Reconciliation (eMR) is a process by which a healthcare 
							professional creates a comprehensive list of all the medications a patient is 
							currently taking, including information such as the proper route of administration, 
							dose, time, and frequency of the medication, which then compared to the physician’s list 
							of prescribed medications to ensure its accuracy. This is done electronically, reducing 
							errors compared to paper-based methods.
						</p>
					<h2>Goal</h2>
						<p>The goal of eMR is to identify and resolve medication discrepancies, and has been recognised 
						as one of the most important interventions aimed at improving the safety of medication use. 
						This uses a process to compare the medications taken by a patient (including name, dose, 
						frequency, route and purpose) with newly ordered medications. This comparison addresses 
						duplications, omissions, and the need to continue current medications.</p>
								
						<h2>5 Steps of eMR Process</h2>	
										
							<ol>
								<li>Develop a list of current medications.</li>
								<li>Develop a list of medications to be prescribed.</li>
								<li>Compare the medications on the two lists.</li>
								<li>Make clinical decisions based on the comparison.</li>
								<li>Communicate the new list to appropriate caregivers and to the patient.</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>10 Features of EMR Software </h2>
							<ol>
								<li><h3>Patient Scheduling</h3> </li>
									<p> - This includes all the patients’ details and their purpose for visiting 
										the hospital. In some instances, patients may not be sure of a doctor’s 
										specialty, but the details available can help them choose the one that is
										 best for them. Along with it, there are options available through which 
										 patients can receive automatic reminders about their visit. If the doctor 
										 is unavailable on a particular date, they can reschedule their meeting. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Patient Portals</h3> </li>
									<p> - This will be helpful for patients and doctors to access the reports that 
										other departments inside the hospital have generated.  
									</p>
								<li><h3>Patient History Recording</h3> </li>
									<p> - If the software is sufficiently storing the data, it will be easier for
										 doctors to diagnose the condition and provide treatment accordingly. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Medical Billing</h3> </li>
									<p> -  It can easily generate accurate and error-free bills within less time. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>E-prescribing</h3> </li>
									<p> - It enables doctors to prescribe medications to patients electronically, 
										and they can take the printouts as well. This feature also includes automatic 
										notifications regarding allergies to a particular drug that can happen. 
										It can assist doctors in prescribing the appropriate medication as they 
										become fully aware of the patient’s health condition.
									</p>
								<li><h3>Order Entry</h3> </li>
									<p> - This feature is also known as computerized physician order. It allows the 
										medical service provider to keep up with all the patient’s details along with 
										the reports and prescriptions that have been generated.It is also helpful in 
										checking whether there are errors or transfers of all electronic orders.
									</p>
								<li><h3>Lab Integration </h3> </li>
									<p> - There are multispeciality hospitals where many lab facilities are accessible
										 to all the patients. Visiting every department again and again can be time-consuming. 
										 With the help of this particular system, doctors will be able to track the delivery and 
										 results of the samples that have been collected. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Document Management </h3> </li>
									<p> - It helps in organizing and managing the documents sufficiently. Data can be organized 
										according to the conditions patients’ are going through. It must also keep track of all 
										the medications suggested to the patients and allergies if they have any.
									</p>
								<li><h3>Centralized Communication</h3> </li>
									<p> - This will help improve the communication between patients, doctors, and other departments 
										inside the hospital premises.  
									</p>
								<li><h3>Mobile Functionality</h3> </li>
									<p> - Make sure that this is accessible over mobile and desktop to analyze patient details whenever and wherever.
									</p>
							</ol>
							<h2>Benefits</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><h3>Reduced Medication Errors</h3></li>
									<p>- Implementation of electronic medication reconciliation systems that are linked 
									to electronic medical record (EMR) systems have been shown to improve patient 
									safety by reducing prescribing errors and virtually eliminating transcription 
									errors. </p>
								<li><h3>Easy Access</h3></li>
									<p>- Electronic medication reconciliation allows doctors and caregivers to 
										access the patient data in multiple locations, allowing for the information
										 to follow the patient across the entire continuum of care. </p>
								<li><h3>Time-Saving</h3></li>
									<p>- By capturing the data electronically in the beginning of patient care, 
										hospitals can save clinician’s time and eliminate the need for duplicate 
										paperwork. 
									</p>
								<li><h3>Enhanced Communication </h3></li>
									<p>- The eMR drives clearer communication about medication between providers and with patients.  </p>
							</ul>
